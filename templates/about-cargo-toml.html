    <h2>About Cargo.toml</h2>
    <p>
    Each crate from <a href="https://crates.io/">Crates.io</a> comes with a file called <b>Cargo.toml</b> (there are a few exception that are probably old).
    As I understand this file is generated from the Cargo.toml that is in the repository which is included as <b>Cargo.toml.orig</b>.
    </p>

    The fields are described as the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html">Manifest Format</a>.
    

      <h2 id="msrv">MSRV - Minimum Supported Rust Version</h2>
      <p>
        There are two fields that help with the version requirements. The older <b>package/edition</b> field and the newer <b>package/rust-version</b> field.

        See the <a href="/msrv">MSRV report</a>.

        <ul>
